/*
Wrap the code you've written in a function called loopy(range, multiples, words) that you call with 3 parameters.

range - should be an array of 2 numbers representing the start and end values for the loop.
multiples - should be an array of 2 numbers representing the multiples you want to replace with words.
words - should be an array of 2 strings representing the words that will replace the multiples.
For example, say we called the function with the following arguments.

loopy([15, 90], [2, 5], ["Batty", "Beacon"]);

The loopy function should log to the console all the numbers from 15 to 90, except replacing multiples of 2 with "Batty", multiples of 5 with "Beacon", and multiples of 2 and 5 with "BattyBeacon".
*/

function loopy(range, multiples, words) {
  const start = range[0];
  const end = range[1];
  const multiple1 = multiples[0];
  const multiple2 = multiples[1];
  const word1 = words[0];
  const word2 = words[1];

  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    let output = "";

    
    if (i % multiple1 === 0) {
      output += word1;
    }
    if (i % multiple2 === 0) {
      output += word2;
    }

    
    if (output === "") {
      output = i;
    }

    console.log(output);
  }
}


loopy([15, 30], [2, 5], ["Batty", "Beacon"]);
